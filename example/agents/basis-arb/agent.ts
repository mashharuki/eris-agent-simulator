/**
 * basis-arb: trade one AMM leg against fair, and hedge the delta it creates on the GMX perp.
 *
 * Every other arbitrage agent here is two-legged *within the AMMs* (clean-arb buys the cheap venue
 * and sells the rich one in the same bundle) because a single leg leaves directional risk. That
 * shape pays a pool fee twice and needs a second venue to be dislocated the other way. This agent
 * takes the other route out: one AMM leg against the fair price, and the perp as the offsetting leg.
 *
 * What that buys, and what it costs (issue #30):
 *   + The perp marks at fair and the scorer values it at fair, so the hedge nets to zero delta in
 *     the score and the dislocation is booked on entry. There is no round trip to pay for and no
 *     convergence to wait for.
 *   - GMX cannot be bundled (it needs keeper execution), so the two legs cannot be atomic. The AMM
 *     leg lands first and the hedge follows a round later. Between them the position is naked.
 *     That is why the hedge is checked *before* looking for a new opportunity: an unhedged delta is
 *     a risk the agent is already carrying, and a new opportunity is one it merely might take.
 *
 * The funding leg of issue #30 is wired but is not a carry trade (issue #78). The environment now
 * models GMX funding and the observation carries the rate and the skew that sets it, so the hedge's
 * carry is priced from what the venue actually charges instead of from a constant. What it is not
 * is income: funding accrues on EVM time and EVM time is not warped here, so a 360-block epoch at
 * 2s/block is twelve minutes and the deployed factor (~63%/yr at a 100% skew) accrues ~0.14bps of
 * notional over all of it -- ~0.02bps at a realistic skew, against the 30bps the spot leg pays the
 * pool. Holding the paid side to collect is not a strategy on this clock. What the number is good
 * for is the sign on the cost gate and the skew it reveals.
 *
 * Baseline (what "delta-neutral" is measured against):
 *   The run hands every agent an inventory basket. That beta is not a position anyone chose, and
 *   the do-nothing baseline holds it too, so by default this agent leaves it alone and hedges only
 *   the delta its own trades created. Hedging the basket as well is a different strategy -- it is
 *   short the market relative to the field -- and it is reachable with ERIS_BASIS_HEDGE_INVENTORY.
 *
 * Env:
 *   ERIS_BASIS_EDGE_BPS          safety margin over the modelled cost (default 15)
 *   ERIS_BASIS_GMX_COST_BPS      GMX round trip (default 0 -- measured: no fee or impact factor)
 *   ERIS_BASIS_ORDER_COST_ETH    ETH kept per order after the execution-fee refund (default 0.0001)
 *   ERIS_BASIS_MIN_SIZE_BPS      floor on the budget fraction a leg takes (default 1000 = 10%)
 *   ERIS_BASIS_MAX_SIZE_BPS      ceiling on it (default 5000 = 50%)
 *   ERIS_BASIS_SIZE_GAIN         net edge -> size ramp (default 10000: 100bps net goes to the cap)
 *   ERIS_BASIS_CLOSE_BPS         close the pair once the exit price is this close to fair (10)
 *   ERIS_BASIS_DELAY_MULT        how much keeper-delay volatility to charge as cost (default 1)
 *   ERIS_BASIS_MIN_LEG_USD       floor on a leg's notional (default 250). Without it the sell leg
 *                                decays geometrically into a dust loop once the inventory drops
 *                                below the per-round cap
 *   ERIS_BASIS_HEDGE_TOL_USD     leave the hedge alone while the gap is under this (default 200)
 *   ERIS_BASIS_HEDGE_LEVERAGE    perp size / collateral (default 2). The perp is liquidated on its
 *                                own numbers -- GMX cannot see that the spot leg offsets it.
 *   ERIS_BASIS_HEDGE_INVENTORY   "1" = also hedge the funded basket, not just what was acquired
 *   ERIS_BASIS_BLOCK_SECONDS     seconds per block, for the funding rate conversion (default 2)
