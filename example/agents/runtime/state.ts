/**
 * state.ts: the agent's own disk, and what the reference runtime keeps on it (#77).
 *
 * Every epoch used to start the agent from `agent.ts` as version 0. In-run self-improvement
 * (ADR 0018) was therefore worth at most the remainder of a 360-block epoch and was thrown away
 * forty times over a k = 40 competition. This is the other half of that: a directory only this
 * agent's container sees, mounted at a fixed path, created empty at the start of the competition
 * and surviving every epoch.
 *
 * What the reference runtime writes there is `versions.json` -- the strategies the model installed,
 * with the notes it wrote and the epoch each one went in. A participant's own runtime may write
 * whatever else it likes; the cap is the whole of the contract.
 *
 * Three rules the rest of the file exists to keep:
 *
 *   1. **Fail soft, always.** A state directory that is missing, unreadable, full or corrupt must
 *      never stop the agent trading. It logs and carries on from `agent.ts`, which is exactly the
 *      behavior of every epoch before this feature existed.
 *   2. **A persisted strategy is untrusted input.** It compiled last epoch under a check that has
 *      since been tightened, or it was written by a model, or the file was edited. It goes through
 *      the cheatcode static check and the vm compile again at load, every time.
 *   3. **Atomic writes.** The epoch can be killed at any block. A half-written versions.json that
 *      is then loaded as the starting strategy is the one failure mode worse than losing the file.

/**
 * JP: 自己改善型エージェントが「エポックをまたいで」何を覚えていられるか（issue #77）を扱う。
 * 本番競技は `resetUnit: scenario` で (regime, seed) ごとに world を作り直すため（ADR 0020）、
 * この仕組みが無いと自己改善は毎エポック version 0（提出時の戦略）からやり直しになり、
 * 40エポックの競技なら改善の蓄積が40回とも捨てられていた。`--agent-state-root` を指定した
 * 場合のみ、このエージェント専用ディレクトリに `versions.json`（採用したバージョン一覧・
 * モデルのメモ）が保存され、次のエポックで読み直される。
 *
 * 3つの原則（読み進めるときの軸）:
 * 1. **失敗は常にソフトに**: state ディレクトリが無い・壊れている・容量超過でも、
 *    取引自体は絶対に止めない（agent.ts から始めるだけ）
 * 2. **永続化されたバージョンも信頼しない**: 前回のエポックでコンパイルが通ったコードでも、
 *    今回また cheatcode 静的検査 + vm コンパイルを通す（検査ルールが厳しくなっている
 *    かもしれないし、そもそも書いたのはLLM/人の手が入ったコードなので）
 * 3. **書き込みはアトミック**: エポックはどのブロックでも kill されうるので、`.tmp` に書いてから
 *    rename する（書きかけの versions.json を次回読み込んでしまうのが最悪のケース）
 *
 * 容量上限（既定64MiB、`capBytesFromEnv`）は**エポック単位ではなく累計**。エポックごとに
 * リセットすると「気長に貯め込む」agentが際限なく増やせてしまうため。
