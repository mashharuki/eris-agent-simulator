/**
 * evidence.ts: what the revision loop knows about the interval it is being asked to judge (#76).
 *
 * The self-improvement loop used to hand the model two PnL numbers, the last twelve decisions, and
 * one observation -- the latest. That is a snapshot. "I lost money during the depeg" and "my
 * arbitrage does not win" both reach the model as a dip and nothing else, and every bundled
 * prompt.md rightly answered "leave it alone", because there was nothing in the context that could
 * tell one failure apart from another.
 *
 * None of that was an environment limitation. The runtime is the participant's own code, the
 * observation already carries the raw signals, and send.ts already resolves its own receipts. What
 * was missing was somebody keeping the history and attributing the outcomes. That is this file:
 *
 *   MarketHistory   one sample per observed block, kept for the revision interval, reported as a
 *                   digest rather than as rows (60 whole observations would be the token budget)
 *   TradeLedger     one entry per transaction the agent sent, from the block it was decided on to
 *                   what the position was worth a few blocks after it landed
 *
 * Both are read-only bookkeeping over things the agent can already see. Neither adds a chain call:
 * MarketHistory samples the observation the block loop already built, and TradeLedger is fed from
 * the receipts computeCompetition already fetches (ADR 0011).
 *
 * The digests are deliberately small. Context size is the participant's inference cost (rules
 * §2.5) and the proxy records every call (§2.3), so this reports extremes, counts and windows --
 * the shape of the interval -- not the interval itself.

/**
 * JP: 自己改善ループ（improve.ts の `buildRevisionContext`）がLLMに見せる「証拠」を作るファイル。
 * 昔は「直近PnL2つ・直近12件の判断・最新observation1個」というスナップショットしかLLMに
 * 見せておらず、「デペグで損した」のか「裁定ロジックがそもそも勝てない」のか区別する材料が
 * 無かった（結果、全員のprompt.mdが「何もしない」を選び続けた）。この問題は環境側の制約では
 * なく「履歴を取って結果を紐付ける係がいなかっただけ」だったので、それを担うのがこのファイル。
 *
 * 2つの主役:
 * - **`MarketHistory`**（class, L237〜）: 観測した毎ブロックの市場スナップショット
 *   （`MarketSample`: fair price・保有量・各venueのfair price乖離・stableのペグ乖離等）を
 *   改訂間隔の間だけ保持し、`digestMarketHistory()` で**生ログではなく要約**
 *   （最大/最小・bpsのバケツ集計・par割れウィンドウ等）としてLLMに渡す
 * - **`TradeLedger`**（class, L635〜）: 送信した tx 1本ごとに「いつ判断したか」から
 *   「着弾後何ブロックで含み損益がどうなったか」までを追跡する。send.ts の
 *   `computeCompetition` が既に取得しているreceiptに相乗りするだけで、追加のRPC呼び出しは
 *   増やさない。`digestTrades()` が「送信N件＝成功a＋revertでマイニングb＋未マイニングc」の
 *   内訳と、trade自体が生んだ損益と「その時点の在庫をそのまま持っていたら得られた額
 *   （＝市場の値動き分）」を**分離**して報告する — これが無いと「上げ相場で含み益が出ただけ」の
 *   戦略が「勝っている」ように見えてしまう（実測: 何もしないagentが同じ期間で+6,562稼いだのに
 *   取引した agent は+6,877の手柄にされていた、という事故が実際にあった）
 *
 * 要約が小さいのは意図的: LLM呼び出しのコンテキストサイズは参加者自身の推論コスト（規約§2.5）
 * であり、推論プロキシは全呼び出しを記録する（§2.3）ため、「区間の形」（極値・件数・
 * ウィンドウ）だけを渡し、生の区間そのものは渡さない。
