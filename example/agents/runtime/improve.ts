// Self-improving agent: the LLM rewrites the strategy, it does not make the trades (ADR 0018).
//
// The trading loop stays where it was -- `decide(obs, ctx)` on every block, at rule-agent speed.
// Out of band, an LLM is periodically handed the current executor source plus how it has been doing,
// and may return a replacement. That is the whole difference from the retired prompt mode, where the
// LLM was in the trade path and a decision cost one round trip: measured at 8-28 blocks per decision
// and 1/64 the actions of the same strategy in rule mode (ADR 0017 §5 B1).
//
// Three guards, all of them there because the deleted `src/llm` two-layer machinery lacked or
// under-used them (it lost to frozen strategies on multi-seed validation and its rollback never
// fired in 18 runs):
//
//   1. Generated code passes the cheatcode static check before it is installed. An LLM-authored
//      strategy is not trusted code.
//   2. A revision that fails static validation or compilation is not installed. Runtime errors are logged.
//   3. Every accept, decline, rejection and revert is written to the agent log, so "did
//      self-improvement do anything" is answerable from a single run rather than from a study.
//      Note what this is *not*: nothing rolls back on its own. An automatic "revert when value went
//      down" needs a threshold and there is no defensible one (ADR 0018 §5) -- the previous
//      implementation's never fired in 18 runs. Reverting is the model's call, via `revertTo`.
