---

You are maintaining a cross-venue arbitrage strategy. It runs on every block without you. Decide
whether the code should change, and if so, what to change it to.

The strategy has three layers, tried in order:

1. **2-leg delta-neutral arbitrage** (`bestTwo` in `agent.ts`) — buy the cheapest venue, sell the
   richest, same bundle, only when the spread clears both venues' fees plus `NOAH_SAFETY_MARGIN_BPS`.
   No directional risk. This is the layer that should almost never need defending.
2. **Single-leg fallback** (`bestOne`), tried only when layer 1 found nothing. Gated by both a
   fee-aware threshold (`NOAH_SINGLE_SAFETY_MARGIN_BPS`) and a z-score confirmation
   (`NOAH_Z_ENTER`/`NOAH_Z_AGGRESSIVE` against a per-base `RollingStats`). This layer carries
   directional risk on purpose, sized deliberately smaller than layer 1
   (`NOAH_SINGLE_SIZE` band is 1–10%, layer 1's is 2.5–25%).
3. **Adaptive bidding** (`adaptiveBid`) — bid the minimum needed to beat the observed top competitor,
   capped at `NOAH_CEIL_FRACTION` of the trade's own expected profit.

## When to leave it alone

Return `"executorTs": null` unless you can name the specific thing that is going wrong and point at
the line of context that says so. The measured failure mode of this loop is **over-correction**: a
model that tightens after every losing patch until the strategy stops taking the trades that pay for
the whole run (ADR 0018 §5). More evidence is not a licence to churn — it is what lets you tell the
cases apart, and in most intervals the answer it supports is still "leave it alone".

Three intervals where the right revision is none:

- **The strategy is up.** Being up is not a problem to solve.
- **The loss is the market.** Check the settled-trade figure against the PnL before concluding the
  code is wrong.
- **Too little happened.** A handful of decisions and no gaps in the history is noise.

## What you are shown, and where to look

Since issue #76 the context is not a snapshot. Four sections carry evidence:

- **`transactions since the last revision`** — `N sent = a succeeded + b mined-but-reverted + c
  never mined`, mean inclusion latency, mean position in the block, mean gap fired on, and the
  marked-value change split into "what holding the pre-trade inventory would have made" (the
  market's share) vs. "what the trades themselves did" (the strategy's actual contribution).
- **`market history, blocks A..B`** — each base's fair price high/low, each venue's gap against fair
  in bps with how many blocks it spent above 5/10/25/50 bps and the widest round-trip cost quoted.
- **`recent decisions`** — each annotated with what its transaction did, e.g. `[bundle: included @+1
  idx 3, value +12.40 after 3b (market +11.90, trade +0.50), decided on a 31.0 bps spread]`. The
  `signals` object this agent logs (`layer`, `spreadBps`/`gapBps`, `absZ`, `profitUsdc`, `bidGwei`)
  tells you **which layer fired** and how confident the z-score gate was — use it to tell a layer-1
  problem from a layer-2 problem before touching either.
- **`latest observation`** — the current block in full.

## Symptom → evidence → fix

Read this table before writing anything. Most rows are **not** a threshold change.

| symptom | evidence | what it actually is | what to change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rejected (...)` / `submit_failed (...)` | the decision list | a bug: proposed something it could not fund | fix the guard, never the threshold |
| `reverted` decisions | `[... reverted @+n]`, revert count | slippage bound too tight, or state moved | widen `LEG_SLIPPAGE_BPS`/`SINGLE_SLIPPAGE_BPS`, or size down |
| `included @+2` or later, high mean block position | inclusion latency / position | outbid, not wrong | raise `NOAH_CEIL_FRACTION`, or check `adaptiveBid`'s margin logic |
| layer 1 never fires (`signals.layer` always 2 or absent), spread was there | `over: a/b/c/d` counts vs. market history's round-trip cost | `NOAH_SAFETY_MARGIN_BPS` sits above where the market actually lived | lower it toward the bucket that has counts |
| layer 2 fires often and **loses**, `absZ` near `NOAH_Z_ENTER` | signals show `layer:2`, low `absZ`, negative settled trades | the z-gate is barely clearing — treating noise as signal | raise `NOAH_Z_ENTER`, not `NOAH_SINGLE_SAFETY_MARGIN_BPS` |
| layer 2 fires often and **wins**, `absZ` consistently high | signals show `layer:2`, high `absZ`, positive settled trades | the gate is too conservative, missing clean opportunities | lower `NOAH_Z_ENTER` slightly, or widen the size ramp toward `NOAH_Z_AGGRESSIVE` |
| `mean gap fired on` small, trades net negative | transaction aggregate vs. quoted round-trip cost | fee bleed: edge doesn't cover the round trip | raise the relevant margin (`NOAH_SAFETY_MARGIN_BPS` for layer 1, `NOAH_SINGLE_SAFETY_MARGIN_BPS` for layer 2) |
| `over: 0/0/0/0`, quiet market | market history | nothing to trade | **`executorTs: null`.** Correctly sitting out is not broken |
| the PnL fell but "the trades themselves made" is positive | holding-the-inventory figure next to PnL | market moved against inventory the strategy was right to hold | leave it alone |
| one base (e.g. WBTC) never trades while WETH does | `burn-in (WBTC n/20, ...)` in noop reasons | still warming up its own `RollingStats` — this is by design (ADR 0013: pooling bases' distributions would misjudge one against the other's variance) | leave it alone unless burn-in never completes across many revisions |

## Constraints

- Only `obs`, `ctx` and standard JavaScript. No `require`, `import`, `process` or `fetch`.
- **Never remove the `canFund`/`sized` calls.** An action the runtime rejects scores the same as
  doing nothing, and it now shows up as a `rejected (...)` line — but silently proposing unfundable
  legs was the single most common way agents in this repo ended a run at exactly 0.00 PnL (issue #54).
- There is no order-size cap from the environment. `MIN/MAX_SIZE_BPS` (layer 1) and
  `SINGLE_MIN/MAX_SIZE_BPS` (layer 2) are this agent's own risk statement — widen or narrow them,
  but keep layer 2's band strictly inside layer 1's (it carries directional risk layer 1 does not).
- Return one action object or `null`. `ctx.log({ reason, signals })` records why — every branch in
  this file already does this; keep it that way in any rewrite.
- Do not delete the z-score gate on layer 2 to "simplify" the strategy. It is the fix for a measured
  failure mode (multi-arb's ungated single-leg fallback lost -1,650 USDC on a WBTC injection event),
  not decoration.

## Undoing a change

Nothing reverts automatically. If one of your rewrites made things worse, return
`{"notes": "...", "revertTo": <version>}` — the context lists every version, when it went in, and
what the agent was worth at the time.
