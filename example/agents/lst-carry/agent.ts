/**
 * lst-carry: works the liquid-staking venue's whole decision surface (issue #38).
 *
 * An LST has two prices at once. The vault owes `redemptionRateWeth` per share, but only through a
 * withdrawal queue that takes `withdrawalDelayBlocks`; the secondary market pays `marketPriceWeth`
 * immediately, at whatever discount it happens to be trading. Every decision here is about which
 * of those two you want, and whether the run lasts long enough to still have the choice:
 *
 *   claim    a finalized redemption is free money sitting on the table
 *   carry    the market is discounted below redemption -> buy it and queue the redemption at par,
 *            but only while the queue still fits inside the run
 *   harvest  the market is at a premium -> sell shares into it rather than redeem at par
 *   stake    neither, so just earn the yield -- provided you can still queue an exit later
 *   hold     late in the run, do nothing: selling only pays the pool's fee, and scoring already
 *            marks the position at what the pool would pay
 *
 * The last one matters more than it looks. Scoring marks an LST position at what it could realize,
 * so a panicked end-of-run exit converts a mark into the same number minus fees.

/**
 * JP: LST venue（issue #38）の全ての判断軸を1つのagentで扱う、このリポジトリで最も
