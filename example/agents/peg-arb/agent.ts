/**
 * peg-arb: buys a market-priced stable when it trades below a dollar, and sells it back as the peg
 * recovers (issue #27 (c)).
 *
 * This is the trade the second market-priced stable exists to make possible, and it is deliberately
 * a *different* trade from redemption-arb's. eUSD has a floor: a CDP will always exchange it for
 * $1 of collateral, so a discount is a claim you can enforce. A plain stable has no such thing --
 * only the belief that it is a dollar and the fact that the environment's dislocation is a window
 * rather than a permanent repricing. So the position is an opinion, and the risk is real: an agent
 * that buys at 0.985 and is still holding at the last block is marked at whatever the pool pays
 * then, not at par. Since issue #27 the scorer no longer pretends otherwise.
 *
 * The whole strategy is two thresholds and a size, because the point is to exercise the venue, not
 * to win with it:
 *
 *   below par by more than BUY_BPS   spend USDC to buy the stable
 *   above SELL_BPS of par            sell the stable back for USDC
 *
 * Both are read off `obs.balances.stables`, which since issue #27 carries each stable's balance and
 * what the market says it is worth -- `marketQuoted: false` means the price is par by assumption,
 * which is exactly the case where there is nothing to trade.

/**
 * JP: 「市場価格stable」（issue #27。DAI等）のデペグを取る戦略。**eUSDだけは意図的に除外**
 * している点が最大の学びどころ — eUSDはLiquityのCDPが常に$1相当の担保と交換に応じてくれる
 * （＝償還という行使可能な請求権がある）ため、`redemption-arb`という専用のより強い戦略が
 * 存在する。一方DAIのような普通のstableには償還の保証が無く、「戻ると信じるかどうか」という
 * 純粋な相場観になる — これがADR 0022と並んで「同じに見えるデペグでも、venueの仕組みによって
 * 全く別のスキルが要る」ことを示す好例。しきい値2本（`BUY_BPS`=40bps下抜けで買い、
 * `SELL_BPS`=10bps以内まで戻ったら売り）とサイズだけの単純な戦略だが、**「何もしない」判断も
 * 含めて毎回 `ctx.log()` で理由を記録する**という規律も参照実装として重要（issue #101:
 * 理由の無い`null`を351回連続で返すのは「何も見ていない」のと区別がつかない）。
