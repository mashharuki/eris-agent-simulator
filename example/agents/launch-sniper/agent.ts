/**
 * launch-sniper: buys every new listing at first sight and sells after a fixed hold (issue #29).
 *
 * The naive side of the `launch` regime. A token and its USDC pool appear mid-run through the
 * registry; this strategy does not ask whether demand will follow -- it buys a fixed fraction of
 * its USDC the block it sees the pool, holds `ERIS_LAUNCH_HOLD_BLOCKS`, and sells whatever it
 * holds. It wins on a launch whose wave arrives early (it is in before the ramp) and loses on a
 * dud (it bought a token nobody else will, and sells it back into its own price impact).
 *
 * Under the round-trip rule (ADR 0022) a token balance is worth nothing at the bell, so the exit
 * is not optional: the strategy also sells when the run is about to end, whatever the hold says.
 *
 * Everything about the token is read from the chain through `ctx.publicClient` -- the observation
 * carries the registry entry and nothing else about a token the run does not price. See
 * lib/launchSwap.ts for the reads and the two transactions.

/**
 * JP: `launch`レジーム（issue #29）向けの素朴な戦略 — 「見た瞬間に買い、一定ブロック保持して
 * 売る」だけで、そのトークンに本当に需要（wave）が来るかどうかを判断しない。`positions`
 * （Mapで自分が保有中のポジションを追跡）していることに注目: `decide`は毎ブロック呼ばれる
 * ステートレスな関数のはずだが、実際には**モジュールレベルの変数で状態を持ち越す**ことが
 * できる（lp-mintの`minted`と同じパターン）。「退出を常に入場より優先する」
 * （`// ---- exits first ----`）のも market-takerと同じ設計思想で、ADR 0022公理2
 * （鐘の時点のトークン残高は全員0）により、保有し続けることそのものがリスクだから。
 * ペアの`launch-confirm`（下）は「waveが来たのを確認してから買う」より慎重な版。
