/**
 * redemption-arb: the CDP stablecoin venue's headline trade (issue #39).
 *
 * eUSD is redeemable against the riskiest Trove for exactly $1 of collateral, minus a redemption
 * fee. So whenever it trades below par on the Curve pool by more than that fee, there is a closed
 * loop that does not depend on the price going anywhere:
 *
 *   buy      spend USDC on eUSD while the pool is discounted
 *   redeem   exchange it for ETH at the oracle price, paying `redemptionRateBps` out of the ETH
 *   unwind   sell the ETH back to USDC, because the profit is in USDC and ETH is a price bet
 *
 * Three things make it a decision rather than a formula, and all three are in the observation:
 *
 *   the fee is not fixed. Every redemption in the run raises `baseRate`, and it decays on a ~12h
 *   half-life -- which inside a 300-second run means it effectively only rises. Redeeming early is
 *   cheap and redeeming after someone else is not, so the first mover prices everyone behind them.
 *
 *   the discount is not free to take. Buying eUSD pushes the pool back toward par, so an order
 *   sized at the whole balance closes the very dislocation it is trading.
 *
 *   the exit costs too. Redemption pays *ETH*, and turning that back into USDC pays an AMM fee. An
 *   agent that compares the discount against the redemption fee alone takes trades that lose money
 *   on the way out.
 *
 * The mirror trade -- minting eUSD and selling it when the pool is at a premium -- needs a Trove and
 * therefore WETH, which the evaluation regimes deliberately do not hand out (ADR 0017 §4). What is
 * here instead is the exit side of it: an inventory bought at a discount is sold rather than
 * redeemed once the peg has recovered past par, because at that point the pool pays more than the
 * protocol does.

/**
 * JP: peg-arb（DAI等の普通のstableを取る）と同じ「デペグを買う」戦略に見えて、eUSDは
 * **CDPが強制する償還権という行使可能な請求権**を持つ点が根本的に違う（CLAUDE.mdの
 * 「eUSD/USDCプールのディスカウントはプロトコルが強制する価格に対する乖離であって価格予想では
 * ない」の実例）。3段階の取引: ①割安なプールでeUSDを買う ②最もリスクの高いTroveに対して
 * 1eUSD=1ドル分の担保（ETH）と交換する「償還」を実行 ③受け取ったETHをUSDCに戻す。
 * この戦略が「公式」ではなく「判断」になる理由が3つ: (a) 償還手数料`baseRate`は**償還するたびに
 * 上がり**run内ではほぼ下がらないので、**先に動いた者が後続の価格を決める**（先着有利）、
 * (b) 買うこと自体がプールをpar方向に押し戻すので、全額を1回で使うと自分でディスカウントを
 * 消してしまう、(c) 償還で得るのはETHでありUSDCに戻すAMM手数料も乗るので、割引幅と
 * 償還手数料だけを比較する素朴な実装は出口コストを見落として損をする。`IMPACT_CONVEXITY`
 * は実測較正値（4.2万eUSDの不均衡で120bps、その1/4を取る売買で36%解消 → 動かした割合の
 * 約1.5倍でディスカウントが動く）。
