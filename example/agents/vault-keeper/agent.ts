// vault-keeper (issue #40 phase 4): the honest creator of a buggy contract.
//
// It is the target the exploit-hunter hunts, and the counterpart to trap-launcher: both deploy a
// contract and put value in it, but this one is not a trap. It deploys `LeakyVault` — a vault whose
// deposit / withdraw is correct — supplies its own USDC, and intends to withdraw before the bell.
// It has no idea the vault's `rescue()` is un-gated. That is the whole point of an *honest* victim:
// the mistake is in the code it shipped, not in what it meant to do.
//
// Under the round-trip rule its exposure is real. USDC sitting in the vault is worth zero to it at
// the epoch's final block, so its plan is to round-trip out with `EXIT_BLOCKS` to spare. If a hunter
// drains the vault first, the withdrawal reverts (no balance), and the keeper is left holding the
// zero-scored stranded position — which is exactly the loss, and exactly the transfer the hunter's
// gain is the other side of.
//
// Self-driven (`run(ctx)`, ADR 0015 §3): deploy, wait for the address, deposit, hold, withdraw.
//
// JP: trap-launcherが「悪意ある作成者」なら、こちらは**「正直だがバグを持つ作成者」**の
// 参照実装。`exploit-hunter`が本当に狙う対象はこちら側（trap-launcherの意図的な罠ではなく、
// 「作った本人も気づいていないバグ」）。deployする`LeakyVault`のdeposit/withdrawは正しく動くが、
// `rescue()`関数だけがgateされておらず誰でも中身を抜ける——本人はそれを知らずに普通に
// USDCを入金し、期限前に引き出すつもりでいる。`exiting`フェーズでの「shares（自分の持分）が
// 残っているか」だけでなく「**vault自体の残高**が残っているか」も両方確認している点に注目
// （196行目のコメント: hunterに抜かれていた場合、sharesはまだ残っているが`withdrawAll`は
// 空振りするだけなので、両方見ないと「抜かれた」ことに気づけない）。ラウンドトリップ規則の下、
// hunterに抜かれれば vault-keeper は zero-scored の stranded position を抱えたまま損をする —
// これがtrap-launcherの被害者側と対になる「honest victim」の実測ケース。
