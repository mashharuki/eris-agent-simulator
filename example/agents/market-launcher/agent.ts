// market-launcher (issue #40 T7): the honest creator.
//
// It builds a venue the environment does not provide — a lending market with an **immutable** oracle
// — seeds it, runs it, and withdraws before the epoch ends. It is the counterpart to trap-launcher:
// the two create the same kind of thing, and everything that separates them is readable on chain
// before anybody commits money to either.
//
// Honest here means something specific and checkable:
//
//   * the oracle is a `PriceFeedOracle`: no setter, and `owner()` answers with the zero address. It
//     answers deliberately — "has no owner() function" and "has an owner of nobody" are different
//     facts to a caller, and only the second is checkable. A verifier that reads silence as
//     "possibly movable" is being correct, so an honest creator has to say it out loud.
//   * the LLTV is conservative (80%), which under Morpho's formula also means the liquidation
//     incentive is small. A creator advertising safety is advertising a thin bonus.
//   * it exits its own position before the bell, because under the round-trip rule a supplier who
//     cannot get out is worth nothing — including this one.
//
// Self-driven (`run(ctx)`, ADR 0015 §3) rather than `decide`, because creation is a sequence with
// state: deploy, wait for the address, create the market, supply, hold, withdraw.
//
// JP: trap-launcherと対になる「正直な作成者」の参照実装だが、こちらは**2つの市場を作る**
// （trap-launcherはlending marketだけ）点で規模が大きい: ①owner無しimmutableな
// `PriceFeedOracle`で担保付けした、控えめな80% LLTVのlending market ②環境が用意していない
// 手数料ティア（500bps。既存プールは3000bps）でのUniswap V3プールを自分でcreate+seedする。
// `Phase`ステートマシン（deploy-oracle→await-oracle→create-market→await-market→
// create-pool→seed-pool→supplied→exit-pool→exiting→done）で複数ブロックにまたがる
// 一連の処理を管理する — trap-launcher/vault-keeper/exploit-hunterと共通のパターン
// （`run(ctx)`型の自走エージェントで複数ステップのセットアップが必要な場合の定石）。
// 「作ったこと」と「正しい価格を設定したこと」は別問題（`POOL_MAX_DRIFT`のチェックで
// 「プール作成は冪等だが、価格まで自分が決めたわけではない」ことを踏まえ、fairから外れた
// プールへは資金を入れない）という点も丁寧に扱われている。
